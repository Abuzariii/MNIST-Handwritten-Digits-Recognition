# MNIST-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition

This repo is similar to my earlier repo where I built multiple models to classify Fashion items by training on Fashion MNIST dataset.
In this repo I used MNIST Hand Written Digits Dataset to train a convolutional nueral networks model.
Some new tensorflow features were tested and implemented like callbacks, regularizations, topKaccuracy, tensorboard etc.
